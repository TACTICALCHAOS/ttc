        <ul>
            <li>Imperial Foundry: Gives the most points. Capture with strongest players. Coordinate the attack.</li>
            <li>Prototype sites and Repair Facilities: Priority target for points; 2 Prototype Sites, and 4 Repair Facilities.</li>

 <p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>First Control Points:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Occupying buildings FIRST earns a significant amount of points.</li>
                    <li>Don’t let the enemy take. Seize control first.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Loot Weapon Workshops</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can collect as much as 4,800 points.</li>
                    <li>16 to 20 Collection sites, locations are random.</li>
                    <li>Points will be rewarded once you leave the collection area; no points if attacked while collecting.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>PVP:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The most efficient way to earn personal points is to zero the enemy. Defending and losing 10,000 troops will give you 40 points. In offense, defeating 10,000 enemy troops will earn you 80 points.</li>
                    <li>In later stages, prioritize facilities controlled by the opponents.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Over Occupying Facilities:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Defending is more difficult than attacking.</li>
                    <li>If you occupy for too long, you get surplus points. Once you lose occupation due to an attack, you lose these points and this can reverse the score.</li>
                    <li>Let opposing players capture buildings, including the imperial foundry. (After taking the first control.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Opponent’s Facilities:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aim to score a large number of points by taking the opponent’s surplus facilities a few minutes before the end.</li>
                    <li>Remove any defenders around the building before capturing it. This allows you to get personal points and also secures the building. (Only do this if applicable.)</li>
                    <li>If you can, burn the enemy to have them relocate.</li>
                    <li>Target enemy surplus points, especially those accumulated in Imperial Foundry.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

		 <p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assign members specific buildings to capture upon entering the battlefield.</li>
            <li>Assign a member to capture prototype sites, repair facilities, central transit, and boiler room.</li>
            <li>Communication is key; notify immediately if assistance is needed.</li>
            <li>Coordinate an attack if an enemy controls a building.</li>
            <li>Rally whenever possible, but if feasible, attempt to capture without one.</li>
            <li>Secure scattered points or “loot” and prevent enemies from stealing them.</li>
            <li>Prioritize first control points.</li>
        </ul>
